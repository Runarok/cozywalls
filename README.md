# CozyWalls

A cozy, minimal front-end for browsing wallpapers.

## What it is

* A laid-back fork of the original CozyWalls project
* Adds a clean, user-friendly UI for previewing wallpapers
* Simple, practical, and easy on the eyes

## Why

I was bored, found the repo, and thought it deserved a nicer front-end.
Used a bit of AI to scaffold the UI, then tweaked things by hand until it felt right.

## Tech

* Plain HTML / CSS / JavaScript (or whatever’s in the repo)

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Runarok/cozywalls.git
cd cozywalls
```

* If there’s a build setup: `npm install && npm start`
* Otherwise: open `index.html` or use a simple static server

## Credits & license

* Fork of the original CozyWalls project (full credit to original authors)
* UI/text: AI-assisted + human tweaks
