# cozywalls

A cozy, minimal front-end for browsing wallpapers.

🌐 **Live demo:**
👉 [https://runarok.github.io/cozywalls/](https://runarok.github.io/cozywalls/)

## What it is

* A laid-back fork of the original CozyWalls project
* Adds a clean, user-friendly UI for previewing wallpapers
* Simple, practical, and easy on the eyes

## Why

I was bored, found the repo, and thought it deserved a nicer front-end.
Used a bit of AI to scaffold the UI, then tweaked things by hand until it felt right.

## Tech

* Plain HTML / CSS / JavaScript
* No heavy frameworks, just what’s needed

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Runarok/cozywalls.git
cd cozywalls
```

* If there’s a build setup:

  ```bash
  npm install && npm start
  ```
* Otherwise, open `index.html` directly or use a simple static server
